        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These bang bang wings are air fried, making them that much more awesome! 
            They’re tossed in a perfectly balanced sauce with a sweet heat that lingers in a way that makes you want more. 
            You could also grill, fry or roast them before tossing them in the sauce.
